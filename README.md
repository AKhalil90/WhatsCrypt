# WhatsCrypt - Extra Encryption Layer To Your WhatsApp Conversations!
A script that provides an extra layer of client-end encryption on top of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption.

## Purpose
I've built a **JavaScript** script that allow a **Web WhatsApp** user to encrypt his conversation with another party using a crypographic shared encryption ke between both parties.

This is just a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for an extra encryption layer over WhatsApp service. So, If you think WhatsApp, somehow, are getting an access to your private conversations, even after their end-to-end encryption mechanism!!, this script is perfect for you :sunglasses:

## Installation
1. Open **Chrome Browser** and go to **[https://web.whatsapp.com/](https://web.whatsapp.com/)**.
2. From the tool bar, select **View** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Console**.
3. Copy and paste the content of **WhatsCrypt.js** file into **console** tab.
4. Watch the demo video below to to see how to set encryption keys for your conversations.
5. Enjoy secret conversations! :lock:
