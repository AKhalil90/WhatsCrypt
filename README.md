# WhatsCrypt
A script to provide an end-to-end encryption on top of WhatApp web-client.

## Purpose
I've built a **JavaScript** script that allow a **Web WhatsApp** user to encrypt his conversation with another party using a crypographic shared encryption ke between both parties.

This is just a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for an extra encryption layer over WhatsApp service. So, If you think WhatsApp, somehow, are getting an access to your private conversation, even after their end-to-end encryption mechanism!!, this script is perfect for you :sunglasses:
